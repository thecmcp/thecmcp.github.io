                <p>
                    We, the CMCP, are a student collective with the shared aime of building an educational foundation for leftist theory and practice on CMU's campus. We advocate for and help organize workers on and off campus, create a space to study and discuss relevant leftist literature, and analyze local politics through a socialist lens; with a focus on class, race, and LGBTQ+ issues, imperialism and colonialism, the labor movement, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CMCP has several working groups that persue projects and campaigns that help further our mission. These include the <a href="./sils">CMU Students for International Labor Solidarity</a> and the <a href="./turnerhall">Turner Hall Review</a>, among others. We also have a general body that meets biweekly to discuss current events, plan events, give updates on working groups, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we host a reading group that meets weekly on [TBD]. We are currently reading <a href="">Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State by Friedrich Engels</a>.
