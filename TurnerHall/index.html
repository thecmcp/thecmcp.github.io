                <h1>The Historic Home of the Pittsburgh Returns in Print!</h1>
                <p>
                    At the corner of Canal and Cherry Streets once stood a hall of red brick and open purpose. It belonged to the Allegheny Turners — a German-American society committed to bodily discipline, mutual education, and political courage. Here, language moved across tongues, from German to English to Yiddish. Here, workers trained not only their bodies but their convictions. In 1883, that hall became the birthplace of the Pittsburgh Manifesto, a document forged by anarchists, socialists, and syndicalists whose vision of liberation stretched far beyond their moment. They imagined a society without exploitation, without the machinery of state violence. They spoke in terms both material and moral: a world rebuilt by the many, not ruled by the few.

                    We name our publication after Turner Hall to mark a return — not to sentiment, but to structure. We hope to provide a meeting place for the many voices of the Pittsburgh Left. A space for artists, writers, thinkers and organizers to gather and share their thoughts and works.
